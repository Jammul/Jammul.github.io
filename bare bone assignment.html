	<h1>The KARnator <span class="tiny">(my under-production vehicle.)</class></h1>
	<h2>What is it?</h2>
		<p>It's a vehicle that moves around and fights other vehicles, this is only mode 1. There is another mode on the vehicle too, and this is just to move the vehicle like a remote control car.</p>
	<h3>What does it look like?</h3>

	<p>The silver metal looking thing is the body of the KARnator. Those things in the middle are the servos which moves the vehicle, the way we progrm them. Then there is the Arduino UNO you can locate it by finding the infinty sign on it. On the top-right corner of the box there is a circuit board which has the pink speaker wires comming out of it. These are the battery connecters. Which split the volatage, and gives power to the servo and the Arduino. Near the Arduino there is a switch which changes the modes.
